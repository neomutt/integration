-.TH flea 1 "July 2000" Unix "User Manuals"
-.SH NAME
-flea \- Report a bug (or rather a flea) in mutt.
-.SH SYNOPSIS
-.PP
-.B flea
-.SH DESCRIPTION
-.PP
-.B flea
-is a shell script which helps you to submit a bug report against the 
-.BR mutt (1)
-mail user agent.
-.PP
-If you invoke 
-.BR flea , 
-you'll first be prompted for a short
-description of the problem you experience.  This will be used as the
-bug report's subject line, so it should be concise, but informative.
-.PP
-You are then asked to assign an initial severity level to the
-problem you observe; 
-.B flea
-will give you a description which severity level is appropriate or
-not.
-.PP
-Then, you are asked for the location of a core dump (normally named
-.BR core )
-which may have been left over by a crash of your 
-.BR mutt (1).
-You can just type \(lqno\(rq here, or you can enter the path leading 
-to a core dump.
-.B flea
-will try to use either
-.BR sdb (1),
-.BR dbx (1),
-or
-.BR gdb (1)
-to extract some information from this core dump which may be helpful
-to developers in order to determine the reason for the crash.
-.PP
-Finally, you are asked whether or not you want to include personal
-and system 
-.BR mutt (1)
-configuration files with the bug report.  If at all possible, we
-urge you to answer these questions with \(lqyes\(rq, since a
-reference configuration makes it incredibly easier to track down a
-problem.
-.PP
-If you are using Debian GNU/Linux,
-.B flea
-will now check whether or not 
-.B mutt
-has been installed as a Debian
-package on your system, and suggest to file the bug against the
-.BR mutt (1)
-and Debian bug tracking systems.  This option was added since the 
-.BR mutt (1)
-project uses another instantiation of the Debian bug tracking
-system, so submitting bugs against both systems in one pass is
-simple.
-.PP
-You are then dropped into your favorite editor as determined by the 
-.B EDITOR
-and
-.B VISUAL
-environment variables.  
-.PP
-Please give us details about the problem in the empty space below
-the line reading \(lqPlease type your report below this line\(rq.
-We are most interested in precise information on what symptoms you
-observe and what steps may be used to reproduce the bug.  Chances
-are that problems which can easily be reproduced will be fixed
-quickly.  So please take some time when filling out this part of the
-template.
-.PP
-The remainder of the template contains various kinds of information
-gathered from your system, including output of the
-.BR uname (1)
-command, output from
-.BR mutt (1)
-itself, and your system's 
-.BR mutt (1)
-configuration files.  You may wish to browse through this part of
-the bug report form in order to avoid leaking confidential
-information to the public.
-.PP
-If you leave the editor, 
-.B flea
-will give you the option to review, re-edit, submit, or abandon your
-bug report.  If you decide to submit it, a mail message containing
-your report will be sent to <fleas@mutt.org>.  You'll receive a
-copy of this message.
-.PP
-While your bug report is being processed by the bug tracking system,
-you will receive various e-mail messages from the bug tracking
-system informing you about what's going on: Once your bug report has
-been entered into the bug tracking system, it will be assigned a
-unique serial number about which you are informed via e-mail.  If
-you wish to submit additional information about the bug, you can
-just send it to the address
-.BR fleas@mutt.org
-with #\fIserial\fP in the subject.
-.PP
-Later, you will most likely receive questions from the developers
-about the problem you observed, and you will eventually be informed
-that your bug report has been closed.  This means that the bug has
-been fixed at least in the
-.BR hg (1)
-repository.  If the answers you receive don't satisfy you, don't
-hesitate to contact the developers directly under
-.BR mutt-dev@mutt.org.
-.PP
-You can also browse your bug report and all additional information
-and replies connected to it using the bug tracking system's Web
-interface under the following URL:
-http://bugs.mutt.org/
-.SH
-ENVIRONMENT
-.PP
-.B flea
-will use the following environment variables:
-.IP "EMAIL"
-Your electronic mail address.  Will be used to set the bug report's
-From header, and to send you a copy of the report.
-.IP "LOGNAME"
-Your login name.  If the
-.B EMAIL
-environment variable isn't set, this will be used instead to send
-you a copy of the report.  Setting the sender will be left to 
-.BR sendmail (1)
-on your system.
-.IP "REPLYTO"
-If set, the bug report will contain a Reply-To header with the
-e-mail address contained in this environment variable.
-.IP "ORGANIZATION"
-If set, the bug report will contain an Organization header with the
-contents of this environment variable.
-.IP "PAGER"
-If set, this environment variable will be expected to contain the
-path to your favorite pager for viewing the bug report.  If unset, 
-.BR more (1)
-will be used.
-.IP "VISUAL"
-If set, this environment variable will be expected to contain the
-path to your favorite visual editor.
-.IP "EDITOR"
-If set, this environment variable will be expected to contain the
-path to your favorite editor.  This variable is examined if and only
-if the 
-.B VISUAL
-environment variable is unset.  If
-.B EDITOR
-is unset, 
-.BR vi (1)
-will be used to edit the bug report.
-.SH
-FILES
-.PP
-.IP "core"
-If present, this file may contain a post-mortem memory dump of mutt.
-It will be inspected using the debugger installed on your system.

-What should the severity for this bug report be?
-
-       0) Feature request, or maybe a bug which is very difficult to
-       fix due to major design considerations.
-
-       1) The package fails to perform correctly in some conditions,
-       or on some systems, or fails to comply with current policy
-       documents. Most bugs are in this category.
-
-       2) This bug makes this version of the package unsuitable for
-       a stable release.
-
-       3) Dangerous bug. Makes the package in question unusable by
-       anyone or mostly so, or causes data loss, or introduces a
-       security hole allowing access to the accounts of users who
-       use the package.
-
-       4) Critical bug. Makes unrelated software on the system (or
-       the whole system) break, or causes serious data loss, or
-       introduces a security hole on systems where you install the
-       package.
