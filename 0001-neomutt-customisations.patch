-.TH flea 1 "July 2000" Unix "User Manuals"
-.SH NAME
-flea \- Report a bug (or rather a flea) in mutt.
-.SH SYNOPSIS
-.PP
-.B flea
-.SH DESCRIPTION
-.PP
-.B flea
-is a shell script which helps you to submit a bug report against the 
-.BR mutt (1)
-mail user agent.
-.PP
-If you invoke 
-.BR flea , 
-you'll first be prompted for a short
-description of the problem you experience.  This will be used as the
-bug report's subject line, so it should be concise, but informative.
-.PP
-You are then asked to assign an initial severity level to the
-problem you observe; 
-.B flea
-will give you a description which severity level is appropriate or
-not.
-.PP
-Then, you are asked for the location of a core dump (normally named
-.BR core )
-which may have been left over by a crash of your 
-.BR mutt (1).
-You can just type \(lqno\(rq here, or you can enter the path leading 
-to a core dump.
-.B flea
-will try to use either
-.BR sdb (1),
-.BR dbx (1),
-or
-.BR gdb (1)
-to extract some information from this core dump which may be helpful
-to developers in order to determine the reason for the crash.
-.PP
-Finally, you are asked whether or not you want to include personal
-and system 
-.BR mutt (1)
-configuration files with the bug report.  If at all possible, we
-urge you to answer these questions with \(lqyes\(rq, since a
-reference configuration makes it incredibly easier to track down a
-problem.
-.PP
-If you are using Debian GNU/Linux,
-.B flea
-will now check whether or not 
-.B mutt
-has been installed as a Debian
-package on your system, and suggest to file the bug against the
-.BR mutt (1)
-and Debian bug tracking systems.  This option was added since the 
-.BR mutt (1)
-project uses another instantiation of the Debian bug tracking
-system, so submitting bugs against both systems in one pass is
-simple.
-.PP
-You are then dropped into your favorite editor as determined by the 
-.B EDITOR
-and
-.B VISUAL
-environment variables.  
-.PP
-Please give us details about the problem in the empty space below
-the line reading \(lqPlease type your report below this line\(rq.
-We are most interested in precise information on what symptoms you
-observe and what steps may be used to reproduce the bug.  Chances
-are that problems which can easily be reproduced will be fixed
-quickly.  So please take some time when filling out this part of the
-template.
-.PP
-The remainder of the template contains various kinds of information
-gathered from your system, including output of the
-.BR uname (1)
-command, output from
-.BR mutt (1)
-itself, and your system's 
-.BR mutt (1)
-configuration files.  You may wish to browse through this part of

+# This script is derived from GIT-VERSION-GEN from GIT: http://git.or.cz/.
+# It may be run two ways:
+# - from a git repository in which the "git describe" command below
+#   produces useful output (thus requiring at least one signed tag)
+# - from a non-git-repo directory containing a .tarball-version file, which
+#   presumes this script is invoked like "./git-version-gen .tarball-version".
+
+# In order to use intra-version strings in your project, you will need two
+# separate generated version string files:
+#
+# .tarball-version - present only in a distribution tarball, and not in
+#   a checked-out repository.  Created with contents that were learned at
+#   the last time autoconf was run, and used by git-version-gen.  Must not
+#   be present in either $(srcdir) or $(builddir) for git-version-gen to
+#   give accurate answers during normal development with a checked out tree,
+#   but must be present in a tarball when there is no version control system.
+#   Therefore, it cannot be used in any dependencies.  GNUmakefile has
+#   hooks to force a reconfigure at distribution time to get the value
+#   correct, without penalizing normal development with extra reconfigures.
+#
+# .version - present in a checked-out repository and in a distribution
+#   tarball.  Usable in dependencies, particularly for files that don't
+#   want to depend on config.h but do want to track version changes.
+#   Delete this file prior to any autoconf run where you want to rebuild
+#   files to pick up a version string change; and leave it stale to
+#   minimize rebuild time after unrelated changes to configure sources.
+#
+# As with any generated file in a VC'd directory, you should add
+# /.version to .gitignore, so that you don't accidentally commit it.
+# .tarball-version is never generated in a VC'd directory, so needn't
+# be listed there.
+#
+# Use the following line in your configure.ac, so that $(VERSION) will
+# automatically be up-to-date each time configure is run (and note that
+# since configure.ac no longer includes a version string, Makefile rules
+# should not depend on configure.ac for version updates).
+#
+# AC_INIT([GNU project],
+#         m4_esyscmd([build-aux/git-version-gen .tarball-version]),
+#         [bug-project@example])
+#
+# Then use the following lines in your Makefile.am, so that .version
+# will be present for dependencies, and so that .version and
+# .tarball-version will exist in distribution tarballs.
+#
+# EXTRA_DIST = $(top_srcdir)/.version
+# BUILT_SOURCES = $(top_srcdir)/.version
+# $(top_srcdir)/.version:

-What should the severity for this bug report be?
-
-       0) Feature request, or maybe a bug which is very difficult to
-       fix due to major design considerations.
-
-       1) The package fails to perform correctly in some conditions,
-       or on some systems, or fails to comply with current policy
-       documents. Most bugs are in this category.
-
-       2) This bug makes this version of the package unsuitable for
-       a stable release.
-
-       3) Dangerous bug. Makes the package in question unusable by
-       anyone or mostly so, or causes data loss, or introduces a
-       security hole allowing access to the accounts of users who
-       use the package.
-
-       4) Critical bug. Makes unrelated software on the system (or
-       the whole system) break, or causes serious data loss, or
-       introduces a security hole on systems where you install the
-       package.
